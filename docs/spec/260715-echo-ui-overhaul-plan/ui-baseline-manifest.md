# Echo UI Baseline and Acceptance Manifest

## Authority

The frozen pre-redesign behavior baseline is `main` commit
`f34dbd5221b71a8539e7fac8559602ade876ed23`.

The accepted redesign captures were rendered from UI commit
`98c1f788616a1279cf051c9d7b6c4806296ed223`. The subsequent clean-room
follow-up `f9615e72` only rewrites the route-label expression in
`app_drawer.dart`; it does not change the rendered interface or behavior.

The screenshot artifacts are intentionally untracked and stored locally at:

`D:\DevCaches\echo-zero-reuse-ui-captures\98c1f788\360x800`

Capture date: `2026-07-15`.

## Device and Capture Contract

- Platform: Android emulator, Android 16 / API 36.
- Logical viewport: `360 x 800`.
- PNG pixel size: `990 x 2200`.
- Density override: `440 dpi`.
- Standard text scale: `100%`.
- Large-text evidence: `200%` for Music Home, Library, and App Settings.
- Animation scales: window `1.0`, transition `1.0`, animator `1.0`.
- Light and dark captures were forced for their respective matrix pass.
- Final application preference was restored to **Follow system**; emulator
  night mode was restored to `auto` and airplane mode to `off`.

This manifest closes the compact Android page matrix. It does not replace the
broader release gates in `docs/spec/260715-echo-ui-overhaul-plan/echo-ui-overhaul-plan.md`: `430 x 932`,
`600 x 960`, landscape, iOS, `130%` text, screen-reader, and profiling evidence
still require their own platform pass before the whole cross-platform plan can
be marked complete.

## Page Coverage

The 24 pages map to 25 target files because Login has separate server and
credential steps. Both themes now have every target file.

## Matrix Summary

| Directory | Files | Required targets | Page coverage | Extra flows / overlays |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `light` | 38 | 25 / 25 | 24 / 24 | 13 |
| `dark` | 27 | 25 / 25 | 24 / 24 | 2 |
| `dark-200pct` | 3 | 3 critical pages | 3 / 24 | 0 |
| **Total** | **68** | **50 / 50 light-dark targets** | **48 / 48 page-theme cells** | **15** |

All 68 PNG files use the accepted `990 x 2200` pixel size. The previous
off-size offline-banner image was replaced, and the temporary root capture was
removed before acceptance.

## Flow and State Evidence

Additional visual evidence includes:

- MiniPlayer paused and playing states.
- Full-player queue and lyrics surfaces.
- Song options sheet.
- App drawer and route selection.
- HTTP confirmation and address editing.
- Local and remote search results.
- Real Embed Service offline job completion.
- Global offline status strip while cached content remains usable.

Automated tests additionally cover:

- MiniPlayer to full player to queue navigation and state synchronization.
- Metadata editor loading, error, empty-candidate, validation, and unsaved-exit
  states.
- Network strip hidden, weak-network, offline, recovery, and 200% text states.

The compact Android 24-page light-dark matrix is complete. Rare edge-overlay
screenshots, such as unavailable playback or missing lyrics, remain outside
this accepted page matrix. Missing-lyrics behavior and the core player state
transitions have targeted component coverage; the wider device and platform
evidence remains governed by the overhaul plan.
